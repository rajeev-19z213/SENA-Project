# Recipe and Ingredients Analysis using Networks

## Problem Statement
The aim of the project is to analyze the different ingredients present in different types of recipes using three networks. Firstly, a complement network for ingredients that co-occur frequently, followed by a standard ingredient network for performing ingredient analysis, and finally a bipartite-graph to represent recipe-ingredient pairs for analysis. The project aims to identify the following,
1. Ingredient Complements
2. Community Detection
3. Niche Complementary Ingredients
4. Associate Rule Mining
5. Degree Analysis
6. Page-Rank Algorithm
7. Similarity between Recipes
8. Healthy Alternative Recipe Recommender 

## Dataset Description
The dataset has a total of 256 recipe names. Each recipe consists of, 
*  **Recipe**: Name of the recipe.
*  **Ingredients**: It is one of the items of food you need to make a recipe.
*  **Diet**: It specifies whether the recipe is vegetarian or non vegetarian.
*  **Preparation time**: Time taken to prepare food.
*  **Cooking time**: Time taken to cook food.
*  **Flavor profile**: Flavor of the dish.
