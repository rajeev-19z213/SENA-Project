# SENA-Project
##Problem Statement
The aim of the project is to analyze the different ingredients present in different types of recipes using three networks. Firstly, a complement network for ingredients that co-occur frequently, followed by a standard ingredient network for performing ingredient analysis, and finally a bipartite-graph to represent recipe-ingredient pairs for analysis. The project aims to identify the following,
1. Ingredient Complements
2. Community Detection
3. Niche Complementary Ingredients
4. Associate Rule Mining
5. Degree Analysis
6. Page-Rank Algorithm
7. Similarity between Recipes
8. Healthy Alternative Recipe Recommender
